1.Understand Asymptotic Notation:
Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.
A:Big O Notation:Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's runtime or space requirements in terms of the input size. It helps in understanding the worst-case scenario of an algorithm, providing insights into its efficiency.

Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.
A:Best-case: The minimum time required for the algorithm to complete.
Average-case: The expected time required for the algorithm to complete, averaged over all possible inputs.
Worst-case: The maximum time required for the algorithm to complete.

4.Analysis:
Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.
Linear Search: O(n)
Best-case: O(1) (target is the first element)
Average-case: O(n/2)
Worst-case: O(n) (target is the last element or not present)
Binary Search: O(log n)
Best-case: O(1) (target is the middle element)
Average-case: O(log n)
Worst-case: O(log n) (target is not present)


Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.
A:Given the need for optimized performance in an e-commerce platform, binary search is generally more suitable due to its logarithmic time complexity, especially for large datasets.
